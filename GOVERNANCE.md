# Governance

Concord is licensed under AGPL-3.0 with no Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

## Commitments

1. **No CLA, ever.** Contributions will never require a CLA. This is irrevocable.
2. **No dual-licensing.** Contributions can never be relicensed under a proprietary license.
3. **Foundation model at scale.** When there are 3+ sustained core contributors, the project will transition to a foundation governance model.

The AGPL license protects the community regardless of governance structure. If you run a modified version of Concord as a service, you must share your changes.
